## Command-line reference

In general, a full analysis with ANANSE will consist of the following steps:

1. Generate binding networks for a *source* and a *target* cell type using `ananse binding`.
2. Generate a gene regulatory network (GRN) for the *source* and *target* cell type using `ananse network`, based on the binding network from step 1.
3. Run `ananse influence` based on the GRN of the *source* cell type and the GRN of the *target* cell type (step 2)

### ananse binding

The `ananse binding` command predicts binding for all transcription factors with an associated motif.

Example command:

``` bash
ananse binding -A IPS.ATAC.rep1.bam IPS.ATAC.rep2.bam \
               -H IPS.H3K27ac.rep1.bam IPS.H3K27ac.rep2.bam \
               -o IPS.binding
```

This command will use `hg38` by default and quantify the ATAC and H3K27ac signal in [putative enhancers](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4066424). This signal will be used together with the motif scores to predict transcription factor binding. If you use `hg38` and the default enhancer regions you can get significantly better predictions by using a more detailed model that also includes the average ChIP-seq signal. You will first have to download this model (you only need to do this once):

```
DATA_DIR=/path/to/data  # set to your preference
mkdir -p $DATA_DIR/ANANSE.REMAP.model.v1.0
cd $DATA_DIR/ANANSE.REMAP.model.v1.0
wget https://zenodo.org/record/4768075/files/ANANSE.REMAP.model.v1.0.tgz
tar xvzf ANANSE.REMAP.model.v1.0.tgz
rm ANANSE.REMAP.model.v1.0.tgz
```

You can now specify this model when running `ananse binding`:

``` bash
ananse binding -A IPS.ATAC.rep1.bam IPS.ATAC.rep2.bam \
               -H IPS.H3K27ac.rep1.bam IPS.H3K27ac.rep2.bam \
               -o IPS.binding \
               -R $DATA_DIR/ANANSE.REMAP.model.v1.0
```

Note that the BAM file(s) should be indexed, for instance with `samtools index`.

Alternatively, you can use your own set of enhancer regions or putative cis-regulatory elements. For instance, to use the candidate cis-Regulatory Elements by ENCODE (from [SCREEN](https://screen.encodeproject.org/)):

``` bash
ananse binding -A IPS.ATAC.rep1.bam IPS.ATAC.rep2.bam \
               -H IPS.H3K27ac.rep1.bam IPS.H3K27ac.rep2.bam \
               -o IPS.binding \
               -r https://api.wenglab.org/screen_v13/fdownloads/GRCh38-ccREs.bed
```

Or to use the union of peaks from several ATAC-seq experiments:

``` bash
ananse binding -A IPS.ATAC.rep1.bam IPS.ATAC.rep2.bam \
               -H IPS.H3K27ac.rep1.bam IPS.H3K27ac.rep2.bam \
               -o IPS.binding \
               -r ATAC.cell_type1.narrowPeak ATAC.cell_type2.narrowPeak
```

#### Other species

Please note that human and mouse are supported out-of-the-box, but for other species you will need a custom motif to transcription factor mapping. Take care to use the same gene symbols for your transcription factors as are present in your gene expression file. One way to create the TF to motif mapping is to use the `motif2factors` command from [GimmeMotifs](https://github.com/vanheeringen-lab/gimmemotifs). See the documentation [here](https://gimmemotifs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html#command-gimme-motif2factors). This command uses a relatively simple approach based on orthogroups. 


#### Output files

The output directory of `ananse binding` will contain one or two files, depending on the input data used. The file called `binding.h5` contains:

* The predicted binding probability for every TF in every enhancer. For every transcription factor there is a key with the transcription factor name and a value that contains the predicted binding probability.
* The predicted factor activity (based on the TF motif activity) for all transcriptionfactors. The motif activity is based on the contribution of motif score to the enhancer activity (the coefficient from a linear regression;  see [The FANTOM Consortium & Riken Omics Science Center 2009](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.375) and [Balwierz et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.169508.113)). In the implementation of ANANSE the motif activity is calculated based on a regression using the ATAC-seq signal and/or a regression using the H3K27ac signal.
* Depending on the input data, the file will also contain `atac` and/or `h3k27ac`, which provide the quantified and normalized signal of ATAC-seq and/or H3K27ac ChIP-seq data in the enhancer regions. If the `ANANSE.REMAP.model.v1.0` model is used, these files will also contain the relative signal. 

Mostly, you would want to use the `binding.h5` as input for `ananse network`. If you want to access the information in the file for other purposes you can
use the `ananse view` command.

If you provided multiple peaks or BED files as input, the output directory will also contain a BED files with the merged regions, which are used as potential enhancer.

### ananse network

The `ananse network` command infers a cell type-specific GRN based on the predicted TF binding sites using `ananse binding` and the expression levels of both TFs as well as their target genes. TF-gene interaction scores, the edge weights in the network, are calculated based on the predicted TF binding probability in enhancers and the distance between the enhancers and the target gene, the predicted TF activity and the expression level of both TF and the target gene.

Note: `ananse network` needs ~12-15GB of memory for a typical analysis of a human network.

### ananse influence

To calculate the influence score for the transition from a *source* cell type (`-s` or `--source`) to a *target* cell type (`t` or `--target`), `ananse influence` uses the GRNs for both cell types, predicted by `ananse network`. For each network, the top 100k interactions are selected, based on the rank of the interaction scores (edge weights). Using the differential GRN, capturing the difference between the two networks, a local network is built for each TF, up to a maximal number of three edges. Using this network, the influence score is calculated based on 1) the edge distance from the TF of interest to the target gene, 2) the predicted interaction score and 3) the change in expression between the source cell type and the target cell type.

The number of edges used is 100,000 by default but in some cases you'll get better performance with more edges. You can, for instance, try to increase to 500,000 edges by using `-i 500_000`. 

Example command: 

``` bash
$ ananse influence  -s results/FB_network.txt \
                    -t results/KRT_network.txt \
                    -d data/FB2KRT_degenes.tsv \

### ananse view

Convert the binding probabilities from  the `binding.h5` output of `ananse binding` to tab-separated text format.
This is only necessary if you want to use the output for other purposes, as `ananse network` can only use the `.h5` file.
Converting all factors may take some time and memory!

Example command to extract the binding probabilities for all factors in *wide* format (one column per TF):

``` bash
$ ananse view binding.h5 -o binding.tsv
```

Example command to extract the binding probabilities for TP53 and TP63 in *long* format, print to stdout:


``` bash
$ ananse view binding.h5 -f TP53 TP63 -F long
```

```
