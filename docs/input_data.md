## Input data

To run ANANSE you need the following data:

* A genome with a matching gene annotation
* For `ananse binding`: enhancer regions (optional for `hg38`)
* For `ananse binding`: enhancer activity:
    *  indexed ATAC-seq BAM file(s) and/or
    *  indexed H3K27ac ChIP-seq BAM files(s) 
* For `ananse network`: gene expression quantification (TPM)
* For `ananse influence`: gene differential expression (DESeq2 output)
* A Motif database

### Genome

To run `ANANSE` on your sample(s), a matching genome and gene annotation is necessary.

#### genomepy

We recommand that you download these with [genomepy](https://github.com/vanheeringen-lab/genomepy).
If you installed ANANSE with conda, genomepy is present in the ANANSE environment.

To install a genome with `genomepy` you can use this command, which will download both the genome `FASTA` and the gene annotation `BED` file, and exports them to the PATH.

``` bash
# activate ananse environment
conda activate ananse

# install the human genome from UCSC
genomepy install hg38 --provider UCSC --annotation

# alternatively, install the human genome from Ensembl
genomepy install GRCh38.p13 --provider Ensembl --annotation
```

You can then use the `-g` argument to specify your genome by name when running the ANANSE tools: `-g hg38`.

#### I have a genome

Alternatively, you can specify the genome manually. In this case you'll need:

* A genome FASTA file.
* A gene annotation in BED12 format.
  * the chromosome names must match with the genome
  * the gene names must be HGNC symbols

You can then specify the genome as follows: `-g /path/to/genome.fa`.
For `ananse network`, you need to add the annotation BED file with `-a /path/to/annotation.bed`.

### Enhancer regions

The `ananse binding` command requires a database of putative enhancer regions.
For human data (`hg38` only), ANANSE provides a [database of cis-regulatory regions](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4066424) (putative enhancers).
Which is used by default.

Optionally, you can specify your own set of putative enhancers.
This is **required** for genomes other than `hg38`.

To define enhancer regions, you can use any type of genome-wide data that is associated with enhancers and *gives narrow peaks*.
H3K27ac signal, for instance, would not work well, as peaks from a H3K27ac ChIP-seq experiment are too broad to provide a precise region for the motif analysis.
Examples of data that is suitable would be DNaseI, ATAC-seq or EP300 ChIP-seq.
The enhancer regions should be specified as a BED file, centered at the summit.
You can also provide one or more `narrowPeak` files, for instance from [MACS2](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS).
In this case all the peaks will be merged and overlapping peaks will be centered at the summit of the highest peak.
If you analyze multiple samples with ANANSE, you should include all the peaks from every sample, thereby creating a union of all the peaks in your experiment.

You can use [seq2science](https://github.com/vanheeringen-lab/seq2science) to map your data.
The (raw) ATAC-/ChIP-seq counts table can be used as input directly.

### Enhancer activity

ANANSE can use ATAC-seq and/or H3K27ac ChIP-seq data to predict binding.
Using both will give the best performance, however, either one will also work well (see Fig. 3A in the ANANSE paper).
These data should be in BAM format, mapped to the relevant genome, duplicates be marked (or removed), sorted and indexed.
You can use [seq2science](https://github.com/vanheeringen-lab/seq2science) to map your own or publicly available data.
For both types of data you can supply one or more files (replicates).
Replicates will be averaged.
The BAM file(s) should be indexed, for instance with `samtools index`.

### Expression data

The expression data normally comes from an RNA-seq experiment.
We use the **gene-level** `TPM` score to represent the gene expression in ANANSE.
In the expression input file, the 1st column (named as `target_id`) should contain the **gene name**, and the second column should be named `tpm`.
At the moment TFs are coupled to motifs by HGNC symbol, so all gene identifiers should be the approved HGNC gene names.

This is an example of the input expression file:

```
target_id	tpm
A1BG	9.579771
A1CF	0.0223
A2M	0.25458
A2ML1	664.452
A3GALT2	0.147194
```

You can create this file with salmon or kallisto, followed by summing transcript-level TPMs to gene-level TPMS using [tximport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/tximport/inst/doc/tximport.html).

### Differential expression data

The differential expression data normally comes from an RNA-seq experiment.
This file can be created using, for instance, [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html).
In the differential expression file, the 1st column (named as `resid`) should contain **gene name** (the HGNC symbol), the second column should be named as `log2FoldChange` which is **log2 FoldChange score** of gene, and the third column should be named as `padj`, which is the adjusted **p-value** of the differential gene expression test.

This is an example of a differential expression input file:

```
resid	log2FoldChange	padj
ANPEP	7.44242618323665	0
CD24	-8.44520139575174	0
COL1A2	8.265875689393	0
COL6A1	7.41947749996406	0
COL6A2	9.62485194293185	0
COL6A3	11.0553152937569	0
DAB2	7.46610079411987	0
DMKN	-11.6435948368453	0
```

**Note:**  The `log2FoldChange` should be a **positive number** if this gene is upregulated from the source to the target cell type, and **negative number** if this gene is downregulated from the source to the target cell type.

### Motif database

By default ANANSE uses a non-redundant, clustered database of known vertebrate motifs: `gimme.vertebrate.v5.0`.
These motifs come from CIS-BP (http://cisbp.ccbr.utoronto.ca/) and other sources.
[Large-scale benchmarks](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/474403v1.full) using ChIP-seq peaks show that this database shows good performance and should be a good default choice.

Alternatively, you can use any of the other motif databases included with [GimmeMotifs](https://gimmemotifs.readthedocs.io/en/master/overview.html#motif-databases) (such as `JASPAR2020_vertebrates` or `HOMER`).
If you would like to use your own motif database, please make sure you create the following two files:
1) a motif file and 2) a file containing mapping of motifs to factors.
The motif file should contain positional frequency matrices and should end with the `.pfm` extension.
The motif mapping file should have the same base name as  the `motif` file and end with `.motif2factors.txt` instead of `.pfm`.
Examples are shown below.

**Please note:** if you want to use ANANSE for a species other than human or mouse, you will have to use the default motif database.
This enables mapping of the transcription factors to motifs.
